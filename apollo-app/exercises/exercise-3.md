# Exercise 3

1. Enhance the graphql server to allow the user to query the books using a custom field and custom value. The custom field and value should be passed as parameters to the endpoint similar to how the id was passed in for the author.

2. Write a graphql query to query all of the mystery books and all of the books with a quantity of 6. This is not an AND filtering. I want two separate results all of the books which are in the mystery category, and all of the books with a quantity of 6.

3. For each book in either result, display the title, authorId, and price.

4. Ensure it works!
